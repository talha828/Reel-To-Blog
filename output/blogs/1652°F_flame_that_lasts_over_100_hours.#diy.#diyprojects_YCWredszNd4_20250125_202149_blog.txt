Hey there, DIY enthusiasts! Today, we're super excited to introduce you to an incredible invention that will blow your mind! Our friends at Pro Dea Wire have created a compact high-temperature alcohol burner that's made from just a few simple materials - a glass jar, copper pipes, and a toilet tank!

This brilliant device is proof that with a little creativity and ingenuity, you can create something truly amazing without breaking the bank. The design is both clever and efficient, with the glass jar acting as a reservoir for alcohol and the copper pipes optimized to distribute heat perfectly.

The result? A wick that produces an intense flame, perfect for camping trips, DIY experiments, or even emergency heating solutions! We're blown away by this project and can't wait for you to see it in action. Not only is it easy to build, but it's also affordable and impressively effective.
