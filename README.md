# YouTube Shorts to Blog Converter

This Python script allows you to convert YouTube Shorts videos into blog posts automatically. It downloads the video, extracts audio, transcribes it, generates a blog using the Ollama language model, and posts it to Google Blogger with an embedded thumbnail. This tool is perfect for micro-learning and micro-earning by leveraging free tools like Google Blogger for monetization.



## How the Script Works

The script follows a step-by-step process to convert YouTube Shorts videos into blog posts:

### 1. **Download the Video**
   - The script uses the `yt-dlp` library to download the YouTube Shorts video in MP4 format.
   - The video title and ID are extracted for naming and identification purposes.

### 2. **Extract Audio**
   - The script uses **MoviePy** to extract audio from the downloaded video.
   - The audio is saved as a `.wav` file for transcription.

### 3. **Transcribe Audio to Text**
   - The script uses the **Vosk** open-source speech recognition model to transcribe the audio into text.
   - Vosk supports multiple languages and provides accurate transcriptions.

### 4. **Generate Blog Content**
   - The transcribed text is passed to the **Ollama language model** (version 3.2) to generate a blog post.
   - The blog includes a title and body, written in a friendly and easy-to-understand style.

### 5. **Extract Random Frames**
   - The script extracts random frames from the video using the `imageio` library.
   - These frames are resized and cropped to fit a landscape aspect ratio.

### 6. **Post to Google Blogger**
   - The script authenticates with the Google Blogger API using OAuth 2.0.
   - It creates a new blog post with the generated content and embeds the first frame as a thumbnail.
   - The blog post is published to your Blogger account.
